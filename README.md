# GlucoAssist

Personal diabetes predictive intelligence system. A local-first, privacy-respecting analytics platform that learns from your CGM data to provide glucose forecasting, pattern detection, and metabolic insight for Type 1 diabetes management.

> **This is a personal analytics tool — not a medical device. Not a replacement for medical advice. No autonomous insulin dosing.**

---

## Features

- **Real-time glucose display** — current reading, trend arrow, and delta from last reading
- **Time-in-range analytics** — tight (70–140), standard (70–180), and hypo/hyper bands across 24h / 7d / 30d windows
- **HbA1c projection** — estimated from 30/60/90-day rolling CGM averages
- **Glucose forecasting** — 30, 60, and 120-minute predictions with uncertainty bounds
- **Hypo/hyper risk estimation** — probability and confidence for each horizon
- **Pattern detection** — nine evidence-based patterns including:
  - Dawn phenomenon
  - Post-meal spikes
  - Exercise-induced hypo / rebound
  - Nocturnal hypoglycaemia
  - Meal-timing consistency
  - Basal drift
  - Sleep-glucose correlation (requires Garmin)
  - Stress-hyperglycaemia correlation (requires Garmin)
- **Insulin-to-carb and correction factor analysis** — 30/60/90-day rolling estimates per time block
- **Garmin Connect integration** — optional daily ingest of resting HR, weight, sleep hours, and stress level for richer pattern analysis

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env — set CGM_SOURCE, your CGM URL/token, and APP_SECRET_KEY
#    See "Configuration" below for details

# 3. Pull and run (replace 3500 with your preferred host port)
docker run -d \
  --name glucoassist \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3500:80 \
  -v glucoassist_data:/data \
  --env-file .env \
  talesofthemoon/glucoassist:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:3500`

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  glucoassist:
    image: talesofthemoon/glucoassist:latest
    container_name: glucoassist
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3500:80"
    volumes:
      - glucoassist_data:/data
    env_file: .env

volumes:
  glucoassist_data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill in your values. The only required variable is `APP_SECRET_KEY`; all
others have sensible defaults.

### CGM Source

Set `CGM_SOURCE` to either `librelink` or `nightscout`.

#### nightscout-librelink-up (recommended)

Run a local [nightscout-librelink-up](https://github.com/timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up)
container, then point GlucoAssist at it:

```env
CGM_SOURCE=librelink
LIBRELINK_URL=http://192.168.1.x:7800
```

No token required — LibreLink credentials are stored in the
nightscout-librelink-up container, not here.

#### Nightscout

```env
CGM_SOURCE=nightscout
NIGHTSCOUT_URL=http://192.168.1.x:1337
NIGHTSCOUT_TOKEN=your-api-secret
```

`NIGHTSCOUT_TOKEN` is the raw `API_SECRET` you set when you deployed Nightscout
(minimum 12 characters). GlucoAssist sends it in the `API-SECRET` HTTP header.

| Deployment | Where to find `API_SECRET` |
|---|---|
| Docker / Compose | `API_SECRET` in your `docker-compose.yml` or `docker inspect nightscout \| grep API_SECRET` |
| Heroku | App Settings → Config Vars → `API_SECRET` |
| Render / Railway | Environment tab → `API_SECRET` |

### Garmin Connect (optional)

Enables automatic daily ingest of resting heart rate, weight, sleep hours,
and stress level — used by the sleep-glucose and stress-hyperglycaemia
pattern detectors.

**Step 1 — Enable in `.env`:**

```env
GARMIN_ENABLED=true
GARMIN_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your-garmin-password
GARMIN_TOKENSTORE=/data/garmin_tokens
```

**Step 2 — Seed authentication tokens (required):**

GlucoAssist caches Garmin OAuth tokens to avoid hitting the Garmin SSO on
every poll, and to support accounts with MFA/2FA enabled. Run the one-time
login script after the container is up:

```bash
docker exec -it glucoassist python /app/scripts/garmin_login.py
```

If your account has MFA enabled, you will be prompted to enter a code from
your authenticator app.

> **Google / Apple sign-in accounts:** If your Garmin Connect account was
> created via Google or Apple, you must first set a native Garmin password
> before this script will work. Go to `connect.garmin.com` → *Sign In* →
> *Forgot Password?*, enter your email, and follow the reset link to set a
> password. Then update `GARMIN_PASSWORD` and re-run the script. Tokens are written to `GARMIN_TOKENSTORE`
(`/data/garmin_tokens` by default), which is on the same persistent volume
as the database and survives container restarts and upgrades.

Once tokens are saved, the ingest job runs automatically every hour. No
further action is needed unless you change your Garmin password, in which
case re-run the script to refresh the tokens.

Garmin credentials are stored only in your local environment / Docker secrets
and are never transmitted anywhere other than the official Garmin Connect API.

openssl rand -hex 32
# or
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

## API Documentation

Interactive API docs are available at `http://localhost:3500/api/docs` (Swagger UI)
and `http://localhost:3500/api/redoc` (ReDoc) when the container is running.

---

## Data & Privacy

- All data is stored in a single SQLite file at `DATABASE_PATH`
- No data leaves your host — no telemetry, no cloud sync
- Mount a persistent Docker volume to preserve data across container restarts
- Garmin credentials are only used to call the official Garmin Connect API
